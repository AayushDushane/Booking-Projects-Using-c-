                                     Booking System Project        

Project Description
This project is a simple console-based booking system developed in C++. It was created as my first project while learning and applying Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. The system allows users to book stays, flights, and vehicle rentals.

Features
1. User Details
Users can enter their personal information including name, location, mobile number, email, ID, and age.

2. Booking a Stay
Users can choose to book a stay in a hotel, rent a property, or book a hostel room.
For hotel bookings, users can select between 3-star, 5-star, and 7-star hotels and specify the number of days they wish to stay.
The total price is calculated based on the number of days and the type of hotel.
Users can choose to confirm or cancel the booking.

3. Booking a Flight
Users can choose between different flight classes: Economy, Premium Economy, Business, and First Class.
They can enter travel details such as the day of travel, from and to locations.
The cost is displayed based on the chosen class, and users can confirm or cancel the booking.

4. Renting a Vehicle
Users can choose to rent a car, bike, scooty, or a custom vehicle.
They specify the number of days for the rental.
The total price is calculated based on the number of days and the type of vehicle.
Users can confirm or cancel the booking.
